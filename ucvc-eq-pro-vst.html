I say almost because a lot of your knowledge as a producer is simply from experience. This will be very long but I have split it up into sections about certain things I think are important. I’ve now been producing for a bit over a year and I have learned quite a lot about not just making music but actually being a producer. Even though I have a long way to go before I become even remotely good I have a lot to share 
25 июн 2018  FabFilter Pro Q3 - лучший?  EQ – кошмар аудиофила.  FabFilter Pro-Q - Хитрости и советы при эквализации / EQ Tips & Tricks. I’ve strictly used FL Studio for the last 9 years. Six months ago, I decided to fully switch over to Ableton. I produce experimental Hybrid Trap / Dubstep stuff, so Serum / synth and bass processing is essential to my type of music. Ableton just has such amazing stock audio effect VSTs, I almost require no 3rd party ones. The Chorus audio effect is especially beneficial to me in order to get those ‘metallic’ sounds. In FL Studio, I have trouble replicating Ableton’s effects using FL stock plugin. MathAudio Headphone EQ VST, VST3, AU and Foobar2000 Component Download Foobar2000 Component - FREE!

If somebody here feels like I've said something stupid/given bad advice, please let me know and then I'll clarify. I might even learn something new from this. Im by no means a pro, I still have alot to learn, but I want to put some light on bad advice

Just a quick introduction; I'm Mr.Goodhand. Today marks the first day I seriously am considering transitioning to Mixer from Twitch. I started streaming awhile back, on twitch, but found its severe level of over saturation to be.a bit.over the top these days. I made several guides on the twitch sub-reddit involving audio, and I wanted to share them with the mixer community. Utilization of these audio techniques is purely. Hello dear mixing and mastering community of Reddit, I hesitated for a long time to create this post, since the Migos and that type of rap/hiphop isn't liked by a lot of engineers. But I still hope that some out there see the same in them as I do and I thing they are doing a great job of serving catchy, vibey music to a whole new generation. Over the past few months I've really tried to get behind the vocal settings of Quavo. I've literally researched every single post and thread New to the L6 world, once bought a PodHD500 on sale then returned it 3 days later, underwhelmed (probably same sound I'm hearing now?) I've used an 11R for years now, and some people complain about cabs and say IR is better now, but I don't think I mind the cab sims in this unit. In fact, I think that might be the biggest issue I have with the Helix sound (other than the RAT being kind of quacky when you use the filter compared to my ProCo hardware rat). I used the 11R input 
I wrote this up at the request of another user in this sub, just to outline roughly how I accomplish some degree of content creation. Feel free to ask questions or pose challenges. #### I first became interested in this practice when I discovered the launchpad app, and that I could assign channel specific effects to different instrument voices in an arrangement, and create new ones altogether. In large part, at least initially, with stutter effects. This spawned a multitude of concepts Is it me or has Live 10.1b12 changed Plug-in handling on the Push 2 a little bit? Whenever I adjust a parameter on the VST with my mouse, it pops up on the Push 2 display. I can't duplicate this on in Live 10.0.6. If I drag an EQ point around in Pro-Q3, I get 2 or 3 parameters on my Push 2 display. They stay active until I change another parameter. By the way, beta 12 crashes a lot (especially when messing with Plug-ins). Edit: This is with "-\_PluginAutoPopulateThreshold=-1". I had a chance to get Cubase Elements for cheap and it's kinda good for what I do. Cubase Pro version might have some features that I like but I'm not ready to pay premium (more than 500 EUR) for many other features that I don't really care for (high-end pro stuff like multichannel sound etc.). The same situation with Studio One - it has the chord feature that I really like but it's available only in Pro (400 EUR) and again I might be paying for many features that I really don't need. So I'm currently using OBS to record audio, then converting the mp4 over to mp3/wav in Sony Vegas, this is an unnecessary and convoluted workflow; Looking to get a software that records only audio. To my knowledge, Audacity is the "best free" suite to deal with recording audio, But I want to know what you guys think a newbie Voice Actor should use starting out. My microphone is a garbled piece of trash, a Neewer BM - 700 Rebrand(Tonor I've been using my Cubase LE AI Elements 9.5 for a while now and I've never encountered this problem before. I have an imported audio file (wav) that i get no sound from. The funny thing is when I hold in right-click and select the "play" function then press on the imported audio track I get sound. On top of it all my metronome sound has stopped as well. This is an old project that I've had for a couple of months and it has been working properly up until last week. \-It's not a "pro". 
Cost Effective Guide to Music Production Music production is an fun yet expensive hobby that can lead to new producers torrenting every vst they see. I’m putting this guide together to help producers get the most value for their dollar when purchasing plugins, and also showing them some useful free alternatives in meantime. Every free plugin I include in this guide is chosen because I believe that they are useful, and can either compete or hold their own against paid for plugins. Purchas. Hello everyone. I'm new to this community though I've been a hobbyist for a while. I prefer making Hip-Hop and EDM instrumentals with more of a focus on Hip-Hop over EDM. I thoroughly enjoy every aspect of making music. From sound design to attempting a final master, I enjoy every aspect of making music. It is a passion, and if ever given the opportunity to even produce for a small artist in the genre, I would do so. I have a question regarding mixing my tracks down for the final. Hey! As I'm sure most of you know you can get sound calibration vsts or software for your computer output to create a flat frequency response. I think the most popular is Sonarworks (https://www.sonarworks.com/). However, if you know the response of your gear, is there a reason why you can't just use an EQ and create your own flat frequency response? This website (https://www.rtings.com/headphones/1-2/graph#353/2031) has my exact model and a really easy to see frequency response chart. People seem to be ignoring Ableton Lite, thinking it doesn't do much, when actually it does a whole lot and well. For anyone wondering about how to get into the power that is Ableton, try Lite on for size. Live 9.7.6 Lite (free version, bundled with selected iOS apps and MIDI Hardware) https://www.ableton.com/en/live-lite (https://www.ableton.com/en/live-lite) (caution you need a serial number otherwise it works without save active) Lite can really get you going as an electronic musicia. This is a long post, so I've attempted to break it into manageable sections with various formatting. And without fail, I see a typo two minutes after I post, so I had to edit it. --- Intro: --- Decided this evening that I wanted to check out the correction curves posted by /u/oratory1990, and a peak meter to help me adjust gain to avoid clipping. You can find his post HERE. (https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/9o2f5n/psa_oratory1990s_list_of_eq_presets/) --- Preparing. Although it is an excellent vst/au host and sequencer, Maschine is not a one-stop-shop solution. Maschine was not meant to be the answer to your production needs, nor was it meant to trully be the center point of your studio. Was it marketed as such? Oh yes, very much so. But if we take the time to read between the lines, we can clearly see the truth: There are better options, and some of them come from NI. Yesterday, for the first time ever, I opened my Maschine Template project in Logic 
Okay so this is gonna be a tricky question. When I was using FL Studio to create music you had and still have this VST called Edison. Which is really handy if you were busy with creating a sound out of the ordinary. (Think about hardstyle kicks) So, now I'm in Logic Pro X and I have this kick, created by a lot of distortion and eq, and if I put the auto filter on at the right moment I get exactly the sound that I want. Now the problem is that I can't put the plugin on and off while exporting. Intro I have a link to a video explaining these concepts available here (https://youtu.be/O__D9IV8T_8). The written guide below exists to come alongside the tips in the video. The video provides audio examples and shows how I set things up. The written guide will cover the same information, but from a more step by step based approach. This is a guide to using guitar amp simulation plugins or software on a computer.
